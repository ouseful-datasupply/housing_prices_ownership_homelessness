= __Transaction unique identifier__:	A reference number which is generated automatically recording each published sale. The number is unique and will change each time a sale is recorded.
- __Price__:	Sale price stated on the transfer deed.
- __Date of Transfer__:	Date when the sale was completed, as stated on the transfer deed.
- __Postcode__:	This is the postcode used at the time of the original transaction. Note that postcodes can be reallocated and these changes are not reflected in the Price Paid Dataset.
- __Property Type__:	D = Detached, S = Semi-Detached, T = Terraced, F = Flats/Maisonettes, O = Other, (bungalows not separately identified; end-of-terrace properties are included in the Terraced category)
- __Old/New__:	Indicates the age of the property and applies to all price paid transactions, residential and non-residential. Y = a newly built property, N = an established residential building
- __Duration__:	Relates to the tenure: F = Freehold, L= Leasehold etc. (HM Land Registry does not record leases of 7 years or less in the Price Paid Dataset.)
- __PAON__:	Primary Addressable Object Name. Typically the house number or name.
- __SAON__:	Secondary Addressable Object Name. Where a property has been divided into separate units (for example, flats), the PAON (above) will identify the building and a SAON will be specified that identifies the separate unit/flat.
- __Street__
- __Locality__
- __Town/City__
- __District__
- __County__
- __PPD Category Type__:	Indicates the type of Price Paid transaction. A = Standard Price Paid entry, includes single residential property sold for value.
B = Additional Price Paid entry including transfers under a power of sale/repossessions, buy-to-lets (where they can be identified by a Mortgage), transfers to non-private individuals and sales where the property type is classed as ‘Other’. Note that category B does not separately identify the transaction types stated. HM Land Registry has been collecting information on Category A transactions from January 1995. Category B transactions were identified from October 2013.
- __Record Status__: (monthly file only) Indicates additions, changes and deletions to the records. A = Addition, C = Change, D = Delete. Note that where a transaction changes category type due to misallocation (as above) it will be deleted from the original category type and added to the correct category with a new transaction unique identifier.
